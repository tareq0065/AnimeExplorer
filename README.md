## Dev Notes

* If you add or change **native modules** (e.g. Reanimated, AsyncStorage, NativeWind), always rebuild the native app (`run-android` or `run-ios`) after installing.

* **Animations with Reanimated:**

    * You must have `react-native-reanimated/plugin` as the **last** plugin in your `babel.config.js`.
    * Animations sometimes do **not** work in Debug mode or may not be smoothâ€”test in Release mode for best results.
    * **Android Animations Issue:**

        * On some Android devices, Reanimated animations may not play if the app is not built for release or the build cache is stale.
        * Try:

          ```
          npm start -- --reset-cache
          npx react-native run-android
          ```
        * For release builds:

          ```
          cd android
          ./gradlew assembleRelease
          ```
        * For more, see [Reanimated Docs](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/).

* **Error 429 (Too Many Requests):**

    * The Jikan API has request limits. Avoid rapid reloads or load testing. If you see a 429 error, wait and try again.

---

## Testing

```sh
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

* **Jest** and **React Native Testing Library** are set up.
* Some components using Reanimated may not be testable due to lack of proper mocks on RN CLI projects.

---

## Known Issues & Tradeoffs

* **Reanimated Animations Not Working on Android:**

    * If animations (favorite flyers, parallax, fade-in, etc.) do **not** work on Android, ensure:

        * Metro is reset after install or babel changes.
        * You're running a real device or a recent emulator (some animations do not play in debug mode).
        * Babel plugin is set up.
        * Release build works as expected.

* **API Limits:**

    * Too many requests to the Jikan API will result in a 429 error. Data is not cached to avoid stale results, so be mindful of usage.

* **Testing Limitations:**

    * Some advanced animations and navigation interactions are hard to mock or test due to current ecosystem limitations.

* **Build Warnings:**

    * If you see Gradle deprecation warnings, see the [Android Build Troubleshooting](#android-build-troubleshooting) section below.

## Android Build Troubleshooting

* **Release Build Fails on Gradle 8+**

    * Check your `android/build.gradle` for plugin and Kotlin version compatibility.
    * Run `./gradlew clean` then `./gradlew assembleRelease --warning-mode all` for details.
    * Update any deprecated plugins or dependencies as shown in the gradle log output.

* **Animations Not Working in Debug**

    * Try a release build.
    * Check babel config and metro cache.
    * Sometimes animations are intentionally disabled or slow in JS debug mode.
